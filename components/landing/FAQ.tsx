      question: "Is this a real person?",
      answer: "No — each companion is an AI with a carefully designed personality and backstory. They feel real because they remember you and respond naturally, but they're not human.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does memory work?",
      answer: "After each call, Solum extracts key details you shared — names, events, feelings — and saves them. Next time you call, your companion references these naturally. You can view, edit, or delete any memory anytime.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I delete what it remembers?",
      answer: "Absolutely. You have full control. Delete individual memories, clear entire conversations, or wipe everything. We also offer a \"memory off\" mode for calls you don't want remembered.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't want to share personal info?",
      answer: "That's completely fine. You can talk about anything — or nothing in particular. Your companions are happy to just chat, tell stories, or listen without you sharing details.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is this therapy?",
      answer: "No. Solum is a companion service, not a mental health treatment. Our companions are great for everyday conversation and feeling less alone, but they're not trained therapists. If you're struggling, please reach out to a professional.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does it cost?",
      answer: "Solum offers a free tier with limited minutes. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited calls with all companions.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I talk about anything?",
      answer: "Yes — life, work, relationships, random ideas, books, memories, fears, dreams. There's no wrong topic. Your companion will follow wherever you want to go.",
    },
